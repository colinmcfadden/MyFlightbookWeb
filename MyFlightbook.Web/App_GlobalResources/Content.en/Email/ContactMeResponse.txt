Thank-you for contacting %APP_NAME%.

I usually respond to requests within a few hours.  

However, I will be traveling with intermittant Internet access from April 4-22, so I will be slower than usual to reply.  I'll be checking in daily, and can handle simple requests like account access issues pretty easily, but if you have a more involved question, it may be at the back end of that window before I can reply.

The FAQ on the site addresses many common questions; please give that a try.
