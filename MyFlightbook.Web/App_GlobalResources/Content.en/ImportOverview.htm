    %APP_NAME% can import flights, whether from a spreadsheet that you create or as an export from other logbook programs. </p>
<p>
    Your file <span style="font-weight:bold">must</span> be in the form of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values' style="font-weight:bold;" target='_blank\'>CSV</a> (spreadsheet) file, which 
    all major spreadsheets can read/write.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <span style="font-weight:bold">first</span> row of the table (spreadsheet) must be the set of headers that identify which column is which</li>
    <li>Each subsequent row of the spreadsheet represents a flight that you&apos;d like to import</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, in Excel, It should look something like this:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="%SAMPLEREF%" alt="Sample CSV" /></p>
<p>
    If you&apos;re importing data that you've exported from another commercial logbook program, you may be able to import it directly; %APP_NAME% can translate
    the CSV exports from a number of commonly used logbook programs, including ForeFlight, LogTen Pro, Zululog, CrewTrac, CrewLog, and ELogSite.
</p>
<p>
    You will have a chance to preview the flights and see any potential errors before anything is imported.
